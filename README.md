# Three-Qubit-Bit-Flip-Code-Quantum-Error-Correction-with-Qiskit
Implementation of the Three-Qubit Bit-Flip Code using Qiskit. This project demonstrates encoding a logical qubit into three physical qubits, detecting single bit-flip errors with parity checks, and correcting them. A beginner-friendly example of quantum error correction for reliable quantum computations.
